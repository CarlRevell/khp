# Our Curriculum

## The provision for children&#8217;s development and learning is guided by one national framework, The Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS 20121). This covers the age range from birth to end of their first (Reception) year in school.

Children start to learn about the world around them from the moment they are born. The care and education offered by our pre-school helps children to continue to do this by providing all of the children with interesting activities that are appropriate for their age and stage of development.

The EYFS Framework describes how your child should be kept safe and cared for and how all concerned can make sure that your child achieves the most that they can in their earliest years of life.

It is based on four important principles that guide the work that the pre-school staff undertake with your child’s learning and development. These principles consist of:

A Unique Child &#8211; Every child is a competent learner from birth who can be resilient, capable, confident and self-assured.

Positive Relationships &#8211; Children learn to be strong and independent from a base of loving and secure relationships with parents and/or a key person.

Enabling Environments &#8211; The environment plays a key role in supporting and extending children’s development and learning.

Learning and Development &#8211; Children develop and learn in different ways and at different rates and all areas of Learning and Development are equally important and interconnected.

The Learning and Development principle divides children&#8217;s learning and development into seven areas:

Three prime areas

- Personal, social and emotional development.
- Communication and language.
- Physical development.

Four specific areas

- Literacy.
- Mathematics.
- Understanding the world.
- Expressive arts and design.

For each area, the guidance sets out early learning goals broken down into easily achievable stepping stones. These goals state what it is expected that children will know and be able to do by the end of the reception year of their education.
