- has the chance to join with other children and adults to live, play, work and learn together
- is helped to take forward her/his learning and development by being helped to build on what she/he already knows and can do
- has a key person who ensures each child makes satisfying progress
- is in a pre-school that sees parents as partners in helping each child to learn and develop
- and is in a pre-school in which parents help to shape the service it offers.
